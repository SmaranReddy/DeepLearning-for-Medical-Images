**Description:**  
This notebook presents a comparative study of classical image
thresholding techniques—Global Otsu Thresholding and Sauvola Adaptive
Thresholding—for brain MRI tumor segmentation. The methods are evaluated
using Dice Score and Jaccard Index to analyze segmentation performance.
This experiment highlights the limitations of traditional thresholding
approaches in medical image analysis and motivates the use of deep
learning–based segmentation models.
